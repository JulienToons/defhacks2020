## Inspiration
At gymnasics we would play this game called Add On almost every day right before practice started. From two to six players we would create a cumulative trampoline routine that would grow larger and wilder with every player's turn.
- We ended up inventing new 'moves'
- Enjoyment w. wil

## How to play
#####Typically, each player plays his/her turn by:
1. Recording a move that he/she wants to add to the routine
2. Preform the routine with the move he/she added
3. If the player failed to hit all the moves, he/she will be 'out'.

#####To demonstrate how the begining of the game with two players might be played:
Player one starts the round with a **dab**
He/she then records the move into a database & preforms the whole routine in front of the camera (there is only one move in the routine rn)

Player two follows by choosing to add a **whip** to the routine. He/she records the whip and preforms the whole routine (consisting of a **dab** then a **whip**)

Player one follows by adding a wild-card move where he/she scratches his/her armpits & dances like a monkey. Again he/she records the move and preforms the routine (**dab** **whip** **monkey move**)

... the pattern follows with [record, preform, evaluate] until one player has failed to do all the moves in his/her preformance.


## How we built it
Charles started by programming server.js
Aayush started with finding an Image Recognition Software to extract a _ skeleton _ representation of the player
Dominik started with visuals for the front end
Julien started with the front end
By 3pm on Sunday we all came together to syncronize the project, help eachother adress minor issues, and complete files like acessing the user's camera that we still needed to begin.

## Challenges we ran into
_ Yes ;) _ - Adolf the raindeer

## Accomplishments that we're proud of & What's next for Add On
We are pleased with our functioning game but we hope to host the game online later on.

## What we learned
We learned about machine learning & cyber security from the mlh workshops and we improved our programming skills.
